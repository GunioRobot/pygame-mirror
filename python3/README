These are special versions of the Setup.in and lib/__init__.py files for 
building Pygame with Python 3.x. For now only a limited version of 
Pygame is provided. Just replace the existing Setup.in and 
lib/__init__.py files with these, then run "python config.py" and 
"python setup.py ..." as usual.

Though all Python modules (.py files) will install and compile without 
error, some may still not work correctly. But the following modules do: 
display, image, mixer, mixer.music, transform, gfxdraw, font, event, 
key, sprites, mask, cursor, fastevent, joystick and cdrom. The Surface, 
Rect and Color types are also available. The following example programs 
have also been ported: aliens.py, chimp.py, stars.py, fonty.py, 
scaletest.py, scroll.py, mask.py, fastevents.py, cursors.py, moveit.py 
and spritetest.py.

Quickie build instructions for building and installing pygame
Oct 23, 2000
-------------------------------------------------------------
pygame is built and installed using the python distutils.

The majority of your work will likely be preparing the
dependencies for pygame. You will obviously need Python 2.0
installed and ready for development work. The only other
requirement is SDL. You should be able to get this compiled
without difficulty. (There is an available devel download
for windows which will suit your needs on that platform).
This is all you'll need for the base pygame installation.
There are extra modules you can use which require other
dependencies like Numeric python and many of the
SDL daughter libraries, like SDL_image and SDL_ttf.

The configuration is controlled by the "Setup" file. Copy
the shipped "Setup.in" to "Setup". Edit this file in a standard
text editor. You need to define some simple variables that
control what flags are needed for each dependencies. If you are
using linux, there is a good chance the flags will work as-is.
Under windows you can edit them by hand, but it might be easier
to run the "confighelp.py" script which will help you look 
around the neighboring directory trees.

Once you are reasonably pleased with your "Setup" file, it's
time to build and install with distutils. This is all handled
with the "setup.py" script. Most users will be able to issue
the command "python setup.py install" and distutils will build
and install everything you need.

When installing, the setup script will look for any of the
dependency libraries in the library paths you have supplied.
If you've needed to give the paths for the libraries, the
setup assumes these dependencies are not in the runtime
library paths directories. Because of this, it will copy
these dependencies into the install directory. This will
solve many DLL errors on windows. On unix systems, this
can help too if you've built the libraries, but haven't
installed them.

On unix, you will likely need to be root to install the
library. The installation needs to create directories in
the python include and site directories.

Assuming no errors stopped the install, you are good to go.
Head to the examples directory and start trying things out.

If you do have problems, first check the error. It is likely
a problem with your Setup file. This is still early in the game
and this process is largely untested. Get in touch with me and
we can work to get this smooth for everyone.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

One drawback to creating your game with <b>pygame</b> is the large amount of
dependencies that your game requires. In order for people to play your game,
they need a lot of libraries installed. For unix users, this isn't too bad,
since most unix distributions come with their own package and dependency
management system. On Windows there is nothing like this, and it is almost
impossible for a Windows user to just download your python source and run your
game.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The best solution is to create a collection of all the needed files for your
game to run. With python this can mean a lot of files. This document will show
you the tools you need to create a standalone version of your game. It is not
difficult.


<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<h2>Download The Tools</h2>
The first thing you need to do is download the tools to build the executable.
We will use the excellent <tt>
PY2EXE</tt> tool. This package extends the distutils to turn your python
code into an executable. You can grab the latest version from the <tt>
<a href=http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/index.html>PY2EXE</a></tt>
page. It uses a simple windows installer to manage the installation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
To use <tt>PY2EXE</tt> you'll need to create a simple distutils script to
run it. I've created a version of this script that I suggest you use. 
<tt><a href=http://pygame.seul.org/ftp/pygame2exe.py>pygame2exe.py</a></tt>.

<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<h2>Build the Script</h2>
There's a small block of variables you will want to change in the <tt>pygame2exe.py</tt>
script to make it work for your specific game.
<pre>
project_name = "aliens"         #name for exe
project_script = "aliens.py"    #name of base .PY
optimize = 2                    #0, 1, or 2; like -O and -OO
dos_console = 0                 #set to 1 to run in a DOS box
extra_modules = []              #any extra modules that are missing
</pre>
Most of the options are pretty self descriptive. When first testing your game,
you'll want to set the <tt>dos_console</tt> value to 1. This will print any
errors into the dos console. When you release your game, you'll want to set it
back to 0, so your game can run without opening a dos prompt.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If you notice your game doesn't run, and get an error about missing modules,
you can add the names of specific missing modules to the list named <tt>
extra_modules</tt>. For example, if your game uses the surfarray module, 
surfarray depends on the Numeric modules, but sometimes it can be difficult for
<tt>PY2EXE</tt> to detect Numeric as a dependency. You can add the missing Numeric
modules to this list and everything will be ok.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Once you are all setup, simply run this script and it will do all the work.
The final executable and DLLs will be placed inside a project directory, which
will be inside a directory named "<tt>dist</tt>".
<br>&nbsp;<br>
You'll notice there aren't any .PY source files in the final directory. That is
because all the needed python source has been compressed as bytecode into the
actual executable file.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
From here you will probably need to copy your graphics and sound into the new
directory with the executable. Once that is done and the game is working, you
can compress the entire directory into a .ZIP file and send it to all your friends.
They do not need any versions of python or SDL installed on their machines. Even
if they have older versions of python </i>(like version 1.5.2)</i>, it will not
interfere with your game.

<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<h2>Creating an Actual Installer</h2>
There's nothing wrong with distributing your game in a .ZIP file. But it is
usually a lot nicer to create an installer executable so the game can
automatically decompress itself, as well as setup Start Menu icons and adding
an option to uninstall. For this you'll need to use one of the many available
installing tools for windows. There are many free ones to choose from, and there
are several high quality ones.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I can recommend <a href=http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.htm>INNO Setup</a>
for creating the install tool, and <a href=http://www.bhenden.org/istool>
ISTool</a> for configuring the package. These are both of the utilities I use
when creating the installable pygame package for windows.

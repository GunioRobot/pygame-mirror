Version: 0.5
January 6th, 2000

Quick installation instructions can be found in the file "install.txt"
in this directory. Look in the docs directory for "fullinstall.txt"
with further details.

With the 0.5 release things are looking really good. We've reached
the point where full python games are approachable with pygame.
Thanks to all that have helped push things along this far. 
We plan on moving up to version 1.0 within a couple months.


pygame is a cross-platfrom library designed to make it easy to write
multimedia software, such as games, in Python.

Website and sourcecode are at: http://pygame.seul.org


This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2, which can be
found in the file  "COPYING".  I reserve the right to place future
versions of this library under a different license.

The best way to learn how to use pygame is to check out the example files
the "examples" subdirectory. All modules, functions, and objects in the
pygame package contain helpful docstrings. Full HTML reference and 
tutorials are also included.

The programs in the "examples" subdirectory are in the public domain.

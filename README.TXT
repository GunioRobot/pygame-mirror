Version: 0.9
February 12th, 2001

Quick installation instructions can be found in the file "install.txt"
in this directory. Look in the docs directory for "fullinstall.txt"
with further details.

Note that basic installation requires at least Python 2.0 and SDL-1.1.7 to
be installed. The latest version of each is recommended. Support for extra
SDL daughter libraries is optional, but also recommended.


With the 0.9 release things are looking really good. We've reached
the point where full python games are ready with pygame.
This is the final release before 1.0, and is intended to iron
out any last hiding bugs or problems. Pygame 1.0 will be released
shortly after SDL-1.2 is available. There is no plan for new features
between this release and 1.0.


pygame is a cross-platfrom library designed to make it easy to write
multimedia software, such as games, in Python.

Website and sourcecode are at: http://pygame.seul.org


This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2, which can be
found in the file  "COPYING".  I reserve the right to place future
versions of this library under a different license.

The best way to learn how to use pygame is to check out the example files
the "examples" subdirectory. All modules, functions, and objects in the
pygame package contain helpful docstrings. Full HTML reference and 
tutorials are also included.

The programs in the "examples" subdirectory are in the public domain.

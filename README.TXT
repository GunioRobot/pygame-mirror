pygame is a cross-platfrom library designed to make it easy to write
multimedia software, such as games, in Python.

Website and Source code are at: http://pygame.seul.org

Installation instructions are located in docs/install.txt


This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2, which can be
found in the file  "COPYING".  I reserve the right to place future
versions of this library under a different license.

The best way to learn how to use SDL is to check out the example files
the "examples" subdirectory. There are also full docstrings provided
with the modules, and a rough breakdown of that is currently in the
"docs" directory.

The programs in the "examples" subdirectory are in the public domain.

of these is available from their web sites.

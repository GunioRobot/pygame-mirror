TODO:
    - write all docs as inline python docs.
    - rewrite docs for pygame doc style.
        - follow the format, and style of current docs.
    - export docs from .py to .doc.
    - create a background thread version for input threads.
        - that can automatically inject input into the event queue
          once the input object is running.  Like joysticks.
    - generate test stubs (probably after docs are written)
        - $ cd test/util/
          $ python gen_stubs.py sprite.Sprite
    - start writing tests.

Uses portmidi library for putting midi into and out of pygame.

This uses pyportmidi for now, but may use its own bindings at some
point.

def get_default_input_device_id():
    """gets the device number of the default input device.

    Return the default device ID or -1 if there are no devices.
    The result can be passed to the Input()/Ouput() class.

    On the PC, the user can specify a default device by
    setting an environment variable. For example, to use device #1.

        set PM_RECOMMENDED_OUTPUT_DEVICE=1

    The user should first determine the available device ID by using
    the supplied application "testin" or "testout".

    In general, the registry is a better place for this kind of info,
    and with USB devices that can come and go, using integers is not
    very reliable for device identification. Under Windows, if
    PM_RECOMMENDED_OUTPUT_DEVICE (or PM_RECOMMENDED_INPUT_DEVICE) is
    *NOT* found in the environment, then the default device is obtained
    by looking for a string in the registry under:
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/PortMidi/Recommended_Input_Device
    and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/PortMidi/Recommended_Output_Device
    for a string. The number of the first device with a substring that
    matches the string exactly is returned. For example, if the string
    in the registry is "USB", and device 1 is named
    "In USB MidiSport 1x1", then that will be the default
    input because it contains the string "USB".

    In addition to the name, get_device_info() returns "interf", which
    is the interface name. (The "interface" is the underlying software
	system or API used by PortMidi to access devices. Examples are
	MMSystem, DirectX (not implemented), ALSA, OSS (not implemented), etc.)
	At present, the only Win32 interface is "MMSystem", the only Linux
	interface is "ALSA", and the only Max OS X interface is "CoreMIDI".
    To specify both the interface and the device name in the registry,
    separate the two with a comma and a space, e.g.:
        MMSystem, In USB MidiSport 1x1
    In this case, the string before the comma must be a substring of
    the "interf" string, and the string after the space must be a
    substring of the "name" name string in order to match the device.

    Note: in the current release, the default is simply the first device
	(the input or output device with the lowest PmDeviceID).

        latency is the delay in milliseconds applied to timestamps to determine
        when the output should actually occur. (If latency is < 0, 0 is 
        assumed.)

        If latency is zero, timestamps are ignored and all output is delivered

        relative to the time source indicated by time_proc. Timestamps are 
        absolute, not relative delays or offsets.) In some cases, PortMidi 
        can obtain better timing than your application by passing timestamps 
        along to the device driver or hardware. Latency may also help you

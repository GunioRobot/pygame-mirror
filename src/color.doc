pygame.Color
pygame object for color representations
pygame.Color(name): Return Color
pygame.Color(r, g, b, a): Return Color
pygame.Color(rgbvalue): Return Color

The Color class represents RGBA color values using a value range of
0-255. It allows basic arithmetic operations to create new colors,
supports conversions to other color spaces such as HSV or HSL and lets
you adjust single color channels.

New in pygame 1.8.1.
<SECTION>

r
Gets or sets the red value of the Color.
Color.r: Return int

The red value of the Color.
<END>

g
Gets or sets the green value of the Color.
Color.g: Return int

The green value of the Color.
<END>

b
Gets or sets the blue value of the Color.
Color.b: Return int

The blue value of the Color.
<END>

a
Gets or sets the alpha value of the Color.
Color.a: Return int

The alpha value of the Color.
<END>

hsva
Gets or sets the HSVA representation of the Color.
Color.hsva: Return tuple

The HSVA representation of the Color. The HSVA components are in the
ranges H = [0, 360], S = [0, 100], V = [0, 100], A = [0, 100]. Note that
this will not return the absolutely exact HSV values for the set RGB
values in all cases. Due to the RGB mapping from 0-255 and the HSV
mapping from 0-100 and 0-360 rounding errors may cause the HSV values to
differ slightly from what you might expect.
<END>

hsla
Gets or sets the HSLA representation of the Color.
Color.hsla: Return tuple

The HSLA representation of the Color. The HSLA components are in the
ranges H = [0, 360], S = [0, 100], V = [0, 100], A = [0, 100]. Note that
this will not return the absolutely exact HSL values for the set RGB
values in all cases. Due to the RGB mapping from 0-255 and the HSL
mapping from 0-100 and 0-360 rounding errors may cause the HSL values to
differ slightly from what you might expect.
<END>

i1i2i3
Gets or sets the I1I2I3 representation of the Color.
Color.i1i2i3: Return tuple

The I1I2I3 representation of the Color. The I1I2I3 components are in the
ranges I1 = [0, 1], I2 = [-1/3, 1/3], I3 = [-0.5, 0.5]. Note that this
will not return the absolutely exact I1I2I3 values for the set RGB
values in all cases. Due to the RGB mapping from 0-255 and the I1I2I3
mapping from 0-1 rounding errors may cause the I1I2I3 values to differ
slightly from what you might expect.
<END>

normalize
Returns the normalized RGBA values of the Color.
Color.normalize(): Return tuple

Returns the normalized RGBA values of the Color as floating point
values.
<END>

correct_gamma
Applies a certain gamma value to the Color.
Color.correct_gamma (gamma): Return Color

Applies a certain gamma value to the Color and returns a new Color with
the adjusted RGBA values.
<END>

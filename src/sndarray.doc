pygame.sndarray
pygame module for accessing sound sample data

Functions to convert between Numeric arrays and Sound objects. This
module will only be available when pygame can use the external Numeric package.

Sound data is made of thousands of samples per second, and each sample is the
amplitude of the wave at a particular moment in time. For example, in
22-kHz format, element number 5 of the array is the amplitude of the wave
after 5/22000 seconds.

Each sample is an 8-bit or 16-bit integer, depending on the data format.
A stereo sound file has two values per sample, while a mono sound file only has one.

Numeric does not use unsigned 16-bit integers; they will be converted to
signed 16-bit arrays.
<SECTION>



array
copy Sound samples into an array
pygame.sndarray.array(Sound): return array

Creates a new Numeric array for the sound data and copies the samples. The
array will always be in the format returned from pygame.mixer.get_init(). 
<END>



samples
reference Sound samples into an array
pygame.sndarray.samples(Sound): return array

Creates a new Numeric array that directly references the samples in a 
Sound object. Modifying the array will change the Sound. The array
will always be in the format returned from pygame.mixer.get_init().
<END>



make_sound
convert an array into a Sound object
pygame.sndarray.make_sound(array): return Sound

Create a new playable Sound object from a Numeric array. The mixer module
must be initialized and the array format must be similar to the mixer audio
format.

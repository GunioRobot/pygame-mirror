pygame.PixelArray
pygame Object for direct pixel access of surfaces
pygame.PixelArray(Surface): return PixelArray

The PixelArray wraps up a Surface and provides a direct 2D array access
to its pixels using the surface its rows as first and its columns as
second axis. It supports slicing and row and pixel manipluation while
inplace operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division and slice assignments are not allowed.

  

While it is possible to assign both, integer color values and RGB(A)
color tuples, the PixelArray will only use integers for the color
representation. Thus, checking for certain colors has to be done using
the Surface.map_rgb() method of the surface, the PixelArray was created
for.

  pxarray = pygame.PixelArray (surface)
  # Check, if the first pixel at the topleft corner is blue
  if pxarray[0][0] == surface.map_rgb ((0, 0, 255)):
      ...

During its lifetime, the PixelArray locks the surface, thus you
explicitly have to delete it once its not used anymore and the surface
should perform operations in the same scope.

pygame.PixelArray
pygame Object for direct pixel access of surfaces
pygame.PixelArray(surface): return PixelArray

The PixelArray wraps up a Surface and provides a direct 2D array access
to its pixels using the surface its rows as first and its columns as
second axis. It supports slicing, row and pixel manipluation while
inplace operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division and slice assignments are not allowed.

During its lifetime, the PixelArray locks the surface, thus you
explicitly have to delete it once its not used anymore and the surface
should perform operations in the same scope.

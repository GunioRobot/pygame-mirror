pygame.font
pygame module for loading and rendering fonts

The font module allows for rendering TrueType fonts into a new Surface
object. This module is optional and requires SDL_ttf as a dependency. You
should test that pygame.font is available and initialized before attempting
to use the module.
 
Most of the work done with fonts are done by using the actual Font objects.
The module by itself only has routines to initialize the module and create
Font objects with pygame.font.Font().
 
You can load fonts from the system by using the pygame.font.SysFont()
function. There are a few other functions to help lookup the system fonts.

Pygame comes with a builtin default font. This can always be accessed by
passing None as the font name.
<SECTION>



init
initialize the font module
pygame.font.init(): return None

Initialize the font module. The module must be initialized before any
other functions will work. This automatically happens when you call
pygame.init().

It is safe to call this function more than once.
<END>



quit
uninitialize the font module
pygame.font.quit(): return None

Manually uninitialize SDL_ttf's font system. It is safe to call
this if font is currently not initialized.
<END>



get_init
true if the font module is initialized
pygame.font.get_init(): return bool

Test if the font module is initialized or not.
<END>



get_default_font
get the filename of the default font
pygame.font.get_default_font(): return string

Return the filename of the system font. This is not the full path to the file.
This file can usually be found in the same directory as the font module, but
it can also be bundled in separate archives.
<END>



get_fonts
get a list of all the fonts sound on the system. The names of the fonts will
be set to lowercase with all spaces and punctuation removed. This works on
most systems, but some will return an empty list if they cannot find fonts.
<END>



match_font
find a specific font on the system
pygame.font.match_font(name, bold=False, italic=False): return path

Returns the full path to a font file on the system. If bold or italic are
set to true, this will attempt to find the correct family of font.

The font name can actually be a comma separated list of font names to try.
If none of the given names are found, None is returned.
<END>




SysFont
create a Font object from the system fonts
pygame.font.SysFont(name, size, bold=False, italic=False): return Font

Return a new Font object that is loaded from the system fonts. The font will
match the requested bold and italic flags. If a suitable system font is not
found this will fallback on loading the default pygame font. The font name
can be a comma separated list of font names to look for.
<END>



Font
create a new Font object from a file
pygame.font.Font(filename, size): return Font
pygame.font.Font(object, size): return Font

Load a new font from a given filename or a python file object. The size 
is the height of the font in pixels. If the filename is None the Pygame
default font will be loaded. If a font cannot be loaded from the arguments
given an exception will be raised. Once the font is created the size cannot
be changed. 

Font objects are mainly used to render text into new Surface objects. The
render can emulate bold or italic features, but it is better to load from
a font with actual italic or bold glyphs. The rendered text can be regular
strings or unicode.
<SECTION>



render
render text to a new Surface
Font.render(text, antialias, color, background=None): return Surface

This creates a new surface with the correct dimensions to hold the text.
The text can only be a single line, newline characters are not rendered.
The antialias argument is a boolean, if true the characters will have
smooth edges. The color argument is the color for the text. The optional
background argument is a color to use for the text background. If no
background is passed the area outside the text will be transparent.

If any empty string is passed for the text, a blank surface will be returned
that is one pixel wide and the height of the font.

Depending on the type of background and antialiasing used, this returns
different types of Surfaces. For performance reasons, it is good to know what
type of image will be used. If antialiasing is not used, the return image will
always be an 8bit image with a two color palette. If the background is
transparent a colorkey will be set. Antialiased image are rendered to 24bit
RGB images. If the background is transparent a pixel alpha will be included.

Images with pixel alpha are generally the slowest to draw in Pygame. These
images are returned when antialiasing is used and no background color is used.
If the other images a font will be drawn to have a consistent color you can
optimize the blitting by rendering the font with antialiasing and using a
background color. After the text is rendered, set a colorkey on the Surface
for the background color.

Font rendering is not thread safe, only a single thread can render text
any time.
<END>



size
determine the size needed to render text
Font.size(text): return (width, height)

Returns the dimensions needed to render the text. This can be used to
help determine the positioning needed for text before it is rendered. This
can be used for wordwrapping and other layout effects.

Be aware that most fonts use kerning which adjusts the widths for specific
letter pairs. the width for "ae" will not always match the width for "a" + "e".
<END>



set_underline
control if text is rendered with an underline
Font.set_underline(bool): return None

When enabled, all rendered fonts will include an underline. The underline is
always one pixel thick, regardless of font size. This can be mixed with
the bold and italic modes.
<END>



get_underline
check if text will be rendered with an underline
Font.get_underline(): return bool

Return True when the font underline is enabled.
<END>



set_bold
enable fake rendering of bold text
Font.set_bold(bool): return None

Enables the bold rendering of text. This is a fake stretching of the font
that doesn't look good on many font types. If possible load the font from
a real bold font file. While bold, the font will have a different width
than when normal. This can be mixed with the italic and underline modes.
<END>



get_bold
check if text will be rendered bold
Font.get_bold(): return bool

Return True when the font bold rendering mode is enabled.
<END>



set_italic
enable fake rendering of italic text of text. This is a fake skewing of the
font that doesn't look good on many font types. if possible load the font from
a real italic font file. While italic the font will have a different width
than when normal. This can be mixed with the bold and underline modes.
<END>



get_italic
check if the text will be rendered italic
Font.get_italic(): return bool

Return True when the font italic rendering mode is enabled.
<END>



get_linesize
get the line space of the font text
Font.get_linesize(): return int

Return the height in pixels for a line of text with the font. When rendering
multiple lines of text this is the recommended amount of space between lines.
<END>



get_height
get the height of the font
Font.get_height(): return int

Return the height in pixels of the actual rendered text. This is the average
size for each glyph in the font.
<END>



get_ascent
get the ascent of the font
Font.get_ascent(): return int

Return the height in pixels for the font ascent. The ascent is the number
of pixels from the font baseline to the top of the font.
<END>



get_descent
get the descent of the font
Font.get_descent(): return int

Return the height in pixels for the font descent. The descent is the number
of pixels from the font baseline to the bottom of the font.
<END>
<END>
<END>

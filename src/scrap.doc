pygame.scrap

The scrap module is for getting and putting stuff from the clipboard.
So you can copy and paste things between pygame, and other application
types.

New in pygame 1.8.  Only works for windows, X11, QNX, Mac OS X so far.
EXPERIMENTAL: note, this module is experimental, and will be changing in 
 the next release of pygame.

get
Gets stuff from the clipboard.
pygame.scrap.get(pygame.locals.SCRAP_TEXT): return text.
pygame.scrap.get(pygame.locals.SCRAP_BMP): return image data.

Return the data from the clipboard. SCRAP_BMP is only supported by
pygame window instances.

put
Puts stuff into the clipboard.
pygame.scrap.put(pygame.locals.SCRAP_TEXT, 'hello clipboard'): return None.
pygame.scrap.put(pygame.locals.SCRAP_BMP, Surface): return None.

Puts the stuff into the clipboard. The content must be a string, but has
no limitations in its size. Thus it is possible to put e.g. serialized
pygame objects into the clipboard and deserialize them when they are
retrieved again.

Raises an error, if the content could not be placed into the clipboard.
<END>

lost
Has the clipboard contents been lost.
pygame.scrap.lost() returns True or False.

Returns True if the contents of the clipboard has been lost.  If it has not 
been lost it returns False.

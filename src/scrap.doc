pygame.scrap

The scrap module is for getting and putting stuff from the clipboard.
So you can copy and paste things between pygame, and other application
types.

New in pygame 1.8.  Only works for windows, X11, QNX, Mac OS X so far.
EXPERIMENTAL: note, this module is experimental, and will be changing in 
 the next release of pygame.

init

scrap.init () -> None

<END>


get
Gets the data for the specified type from the clipboard.
scrap.get (type) -> string

Returns the data for the specified type from the clipboard.
The data is returned as string and might need further processing.
If no data for the passed type is available, None is returned.
<END>

get_types
Gets a list of the available clipboard types.
scrap.get_types () -> list

Gets a list of strings with the identifiers for the available
clipboard types. Each identifier can be used in the scrap.get()
method to get the clipboard content of the specific type.
If there is no data in the clipboard, an empty list is returned.
<END>

put
Places data into the clipboard.
scrap.put(type, data) -> None

Places data for a specific clipboard type into the clipboard.
The data must be a string buffer.
The method raises an exception, if the content could not be placed
into the clipboard.
<END>

contains
Checks, whether a certain type is available in the clipboard.
scrap.contains (type) -> bool

Returns True, if data for the passed type is available in the
clipboard, False otherwise.
<END>


lost
Checks whether the clipboard is currently owned by the application
scrap.lost() -> bool

Returns true, if the clipboard is currently owned by the pygame
application, false otherwise.
<END>


set_mode
Sets the clipboard access mode.
scrap.set_mode(mode) -> None

Sets the access mode for the clipboard. This is only of interest for X11
environments, where clipboard modes for mouse selections
(SRAP_SELECTION) and the clipboard (SCRAP_CLIPBOARD) are available. The
method does not have any influence on other environments.

If a value different from SCRAP_CLIPBOARD or SCRAP_SELECTION is passed,
a ValueError will be raised.

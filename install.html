<h2 align=center>Pygame Installation</h2>

<p>
Python can be built from source, but the easiest way to build is
get a binary package for your type of system and version of python.
This document will give you information on either type of installation.
</p>

<big><b><u>Windows Binary Installer</u></b></big><blockquote><p>
This is probably the most popular method of installation. If you are
running on windows, it is highly recommended you use this form
of installing. The installers come with with nearly everything
you need, and have an easy point and click installers.
</p><p>
The first thing you will need is an installation of Python. Python
binary installers make it easy to get this done. Pygame binaries
usually come for the latest 2 releases of python, so you'll want to be fairly
up to date.
<p></p>
Once that is in place, you want to download the appropriate
windows binary. From the pygame downloads page you can find the .EXE
file you need. This will automatically install all of pygame and all the SDL
dependencies.
</p><p>
You will also probably want to install the windows documentation and
installation package. This will add easy links to the different documentation
and games that come with pygame. The installer for this is easily found
next to the other windows binary downloads.
</p><p>
One other thing the windows binaries are missing is the Numeric Python
package. You can easily install this separately and it will allow you to use
the pygame "surfarray" module. There are binary installers from the
Numeric download page.

<big><b><u>Unix Binary Packages</u></b></big><blockquote><p>
For many unix systems, the easiest way to install pygame is
from source. Still, there are binary packages available for
different distributions.
<p></p>
There are several binary RPM packages for linux machines. These are
actually a little bit of work to install, since you will also need
several RPM packages for the dependencies. There is a good chance
your linux distribution came with the needed dependencies (like Python
and SDL). There are binary RPMs available from the
website for each dependency.
</p><p>
For debian systems, pygame is actively maintained in the debian
archives. It is available for the "woody" release. Visit the
debian pygame page for more information.

</p><p>
FreeBSD also has an active pygame package. While techinicaly it
isn't binary, it is automatically built and installed by the 
ports manager. See the FreeBSD package page for more information.

<big><b><u>Macintosh Binaries</u></b></big><blockquote><p>
There are separate binaries for both MacOS and OSX. For both
these operating systems, there are several remaining problems
with the Python and SDL dependencies. Therefore the binary
packages for pygame also come with fixed versions of python
and the SDL libraries. 
<p></p>
For MacOS, binaries are available on the pygame downloads page. 
<a href=http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml>http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml</a>.
Unfortunately the binaries are stuck at pygame version-1.1.
<p></p>
For OSX, there is also a large collection of binary files. Currently
these are available at the OSX packager's website,
<a href=http://redivi.com/~bob/>http://redivi.com/~bob/</a>.
Visit the site for more information on current issues with the
OSX port, as well as screenshots of OSX pygame in action.

<big><b><u>Installing From Source</u></b></big><blockquote><p>
Compiling and installing pygame is handled by Python's distutils.
Pygame also comes with some scripts to automatically configure
the flags needed to build pygame. Use the "setup.py" script to
start the installation.
<p></p>
The first time you run the setup script, it will call the 
"config.py" script. This will build a "Setup" file which
stores all the information needed to compile. The "config.py"
will do a good job of detecting what dependencies are available
and where they are located. If it isn't perfect, it is easy to
build your own, or edit the created "Setup" text file. This
"Setup" file is a simple Makefile-like text file. It defines
variables needed to use each dependency, and then enables
all the pygame modules with found dependencies. If you have
trouble compiling, you should be able to easily fix any problems
inside the "Setup" file.
<p></p>
Running the "setup.py" script will call distutils to build and
install the pygame package. Distutils actually supports a wide
variety of compile and install options. running "python setup.py help"
will start to show you the different options available. You can
change many things like install locations, compiler to use, and more.
Calling the "setup.py" script with no arguments and it will just
ask you if you want the default flags needed to compile and install.
</p></blockquote><br>

<big><b><u>Windows Compiling Info</u></b></big><blockquote><p>
Compiling all the dependencies on windows is a real challenge.
Fortunately there is zip file with all the libraries and headers
you need to compile. You should definitely unzip this into your
pygame source folder, and all the files go into a "prebuilt"
subdirectory. The autoconfigure "config.py" script will find
this prebuilt directory and make use of it for you.
<a href=http://www.pygame.org/ftp/win32-dependencies.zip>http://www.pygame.org/ftp/win32-dependencies.zip</a>.
If you don't use the prebuilt binaries directory, the autoconfig
script will scan the neighboring directory trees to find the 
dependencies.
<p></p>
When installing on windows, the "setup.py" script will also copy
all the used .DLL files into the pygame directory.
</p></blockquote><br>

<big><b><u>Unix Compiling Info</u></b></big><blockquote><p>
Compiling from linux shouldn't give you any problems. One thing
you must keep in mind is that most linux packages separate the
actual library from the "dev" files needed to compile. To build on
linux you'll need to make sure the packages like "SDL-dev" are
installed.
<p></p>
You can check to see if SDL is ready to be built from by running
the command "sdl-config" and seeing if it is found.
<p></p>
Depending on where the SMPEG headers are installed, the pygame
"config.py" script might not actually find it. If this happens
you can easily fix the SMPEG line in the "Setup" script to
use the correct flags. Then also uncomment the line for the
"movie" module.
</p></blockquote><br>

<big><b><u>OSX Compiling Info</u></b></big><blockquote><p>
Building pygame on OSX is not really supported yet. Actually,
the "config.py" script will actually do a good job on OSX.
Unfortunately, there are some bugs with both SDL and Python
for OSX, so it will be difficult to build a working version
of pygame on your own. You will also need to build the SDL
libraries as ".dylib" libraries, which is not the default
build mode for these.

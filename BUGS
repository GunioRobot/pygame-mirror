CDROM & Joystick:
	Both work, but the interface needs to be rethought. Currently, 
	they are similar to the pysdl interface (which is too similar 
	to the C interface)

Surfarray:
	Doesn't support all surface types between all array types. Best 
	support is for 32bit surfaces.


There are likely plenty of others. This is an early release, and much
testing is pending.

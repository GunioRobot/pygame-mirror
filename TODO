TODO list for the 1.0 release:

 * Joystick and CDROM modules need to be cleaned up
 * Support for OpenGL
 * Support for Piddle
 * More testing and general usage cleanup
 * Surfarray with alpha and colormap support

The plan is to ramp up to a 1.0 release within a couple months. At
that point the only real plan will be keeping in stride with SDL
and other dependency version releases.

Until that point, consider the current interface to be a bit flexible.
Things could change that will break code relying on older versions. Any
changes will be easy to make. There will be warning of coming changes,
but just know that it will likely happen.

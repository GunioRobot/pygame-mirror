More complete installation instructions are available in the docs directory.

Note that basic installation requires at least Python 2.0 and SDL-1.1.5 to
be installed. The latest version of each is recommended. Support for extra
SDL daughter libraries is optional, but also recommended.

The basic way to get pygame compiled and installed is to run the included
"config.py" script. This will do a reasonably automated config for your
platform type. eventually this will create a customized copy of the "Setup.in"
file, named "Setup". It is also easy to make your own copy of "Setup.in"
and edit by hand.

Once your "Setup" file is created, you need to run distutils. This is done
by the command, "python setup.py install". This will (hopefully) compile and
install all available pygame modules.

From here either head to the more complete installation instructions in the
docs directory. Or, if no errors, head to the examples directory to
see everything working.

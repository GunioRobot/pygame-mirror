More complete installation instructions are available in the docs directory.

Note that basic installation requires at least Python 2.0 and SDL-1.1.7 to
be installed. The latest version of each is recommended. Support for extra
SDL daughter libraries is optional, but also recommended.

If you have downloaded the complete windows binary download, there is no
need to run the configure script. That distribution comes with everything
you need preconfigured.

The basic way to get pygame compiled and installed is to run the included
"config.py" script. This will do a reasonably automated config for your
platform type. eventually this will create a customized copy of the "Setup.in"
file, named "Setup". It is also easy to make your own copy of "Setup.in"
and edit by hand.

On Windows systems, it is usually easiest to download the precompiled
binaries for all the pygame dependencies. This download will come with
its own "Setup" file that you will want to use.

On Unix systems, the Setup file will be configured for the SDL dependency,
as well as hunt for the optional ones. There is a chance the Setup will
work as-is if all dependencies have been installed similarly. Otherwise
configure the dependencies by hand and comment out the optional modules
which you don't have dependencies for.

Once your "Setup" file is created, you need to run distutils. This is done
by the command, "python setup.py install". This will (hopefully) compile and
install all available pygame modules.

From here either head to the more complete installation instructions in the
docs directory. Or, if no errors, head to the examples directory to
see everything working. The only demo that requires no optional libraries
is the "stars.py" example.
